PyHacks is a tutorial repo managed by Gary Hutson from <a href="https://hutsons-hacks.info/">hutsons-hacks.info</a>. This has been created to enable people to get up to speed quickly and to enable people to learn from my pain of learning Python about 4 years ago. This will act as a support to my YouTube tutorials. 

## What's contained

### Python Basics, Programming and OOP
The list below shows all the current files for getting up to speed with Python quickly:

- [Lists](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/01_Lists.py) - Python's main data type 
- [Tuples](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/02_Tuples.py) - Python's immutable type (cannot be changed)
- [Dictionaries](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/03_Dictionaries.py) - dictionaries allow for the storage of multiple types in one place. These are essentially the drivers for Panda's data frames. The difference between a dictionary and the other types is that it does not allow multiple of the same keys. Therefore, only unique keys can be allocated.
- [Sets](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/04_Sets.py) - Sets are the final type of data structure used in Python
- [Conditional Logic](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/05_ConditionalLogic.py) - learn how to if else like the best of them

- [Lambda Functions](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/08_Lambda_Anon_Funcs.py) - learn the power of anonymous functions in Python
- [Classes and Class Methods](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/09_Classes_with_Python.py) - create your first class and learn about class methods
- [Classes with getters and setters](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/10_Classes_with_Python_Getters_Setters.py) - explore the concept of class getters and setters to read and edit properties in Python, albeit there is no concept of hiding variables like other OOP
- [Inheritance and Transformers Classes](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/tree/main/11_Inheritance_and_OverloadingMethods) - learn how you can use cool features from a class and reduce the number of line typed by inheriting features from the base class
- [Creating your own Iterators](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/12_Iterators.py) - create your own iterators to enable custom iteration
- [Function Scope - Local vs Global](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/13_FunctionScope.py) - learn about local and global scope
- [Working with Dates](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/14_Dates.py) - work with dates in Python
- [Parsing JSON](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/15_JSON.py) - Learn how to work with JSON objects from websites and parse them in Python with the json library
- [Mathematics aka the Math Library](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/16_Math.py) - get comfortable with the math package
- [Regex - Regular Expressions](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/17_Regular_Expressions.py) - the weird world of text formatting with regex and strings
- [Error Handling - try.except.finally](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/18_ErrorHandling.py) - learn how to allow your programmes to fail gracefully!
- [User Input and Replacement String Formatting](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/19_UserInput_and_StringFormatting.py) - understand user input and string replacement
- [File Input and Output](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/20_File_IO_Read_and_Write_data.py) - work with the operating system to create, write files, make and delete folders, get system attributes and learn how to create a machine shutdown function (do not change the != or it will shutdown your system when it runs).

### Pandas - DataFrames and Series
- [Pandas - Getting started](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/21_Pandas/21_1_GettingStarted.py) - starts your slowly.
- [Working with Pandas Series](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/21_Pandas/21_2_Series.py.) - 1d series objects - used a lot with time series data.
- [DataFrames - indexing and creation](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/21_Pandas/21_3_DataFrames.py) - DataFrames - creating, indexing and extracting elements.

- [Creating subplots](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/22_Matplotlib/22_4_Matplot_Subplotting.py) - learn how to create subplots.
- [Scatter Chart creation](https://github.com/StatsGary/PyHacks-Tutorials/blob/main/22_Matplotlib/22_5_Matplot_Scatter.py) - learn how to visualise correlations and work with scatter charts.
